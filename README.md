# Social Media Analysis - ReadMe

## Introduction:
The provided script is a basic R code for conducting a social media analysis. The script loads a dataset from a CSV file, performs some exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizes various aspects of the data using histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and more. The analysis mainly focuses on variables like age, followers, and posts, among others.

## Features:
1. **Data Import**: Using R's `read.csv` function to import data.
2. **Data Overview**: Displays the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
3. **Summary Statistics**: Provides a statistical summary of the dataset.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creates histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to explore the distribution and relationships between variables.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Computes a correlation matrix for selected variables.

## Prerequisites:

### Software:
1. **R**: Ensure you have R and optionally RStudio installed.

### R Libraries:
Make sure to have the following R libraries installed:
1. `ggplot2` - For data visualization.

You can install it using:

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

## How to Run:

### Preparing your Data:
1. Ensure your CSV data file is saved in the location: "file_path - Sheet1.csv".
2. If your file is in a different location or has a different name, please update the path in the `read.csv` function.

### Executing the Script:
1. Save the provided R script to a file, say `SocialMediaAnalysis.R`.
2. Open R or RStudio.
3. Set the working directory to where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using the command:
```R
source("SocialMediaAnalysis.R")
```

## Analysis:

1. **Age Distribution**: A histogram showcasing the age distribution of the users.
2. **Followers Distribution**: A histogram displaying the distribution of the number of followers.
3. **Followers by Gender**: A boxplot presenting a comparison of followers count based on gender.
4. **Followers vs. Posts**: A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the number of posts and the number of followers, with different colors representing different genders.
5. **Correlation Matrix**: This provides insights into how certain numeric variables relate to each other.

## Note:
Always inspect the CSV data to understand its structure, missing values, and types of columns before conducting analysis. This ensures accurate and meaningful insights.

## Conclusion:
The social media analysis script offers an introductory overview of a dataset that seems to be related to social media users. It's a starting point for deeper and more focused analysis. Remember to interpret visualizations and statistics in the context of the domain (in this case, social media) for meaningful insights.
